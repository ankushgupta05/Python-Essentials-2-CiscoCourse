| Question | Answer | Explanation |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Question 1:** If we assume that pythons, vipers, and cobras are subclasses of the same superclass, what would you call it? | Snake, reptile, vertebrate, animal – all these answers are acceptable. | Any of these can be an appropriate name for the superclass as they all represent categories that could include pythons, vipers, and cobras. |
| **Question 2:** Try to name a few python class subclasses. | [Your Answer] | [Explanation of the subclasses you would name.] |
| **Question 3:** Can you name one of your classes just "class"? | No, you can't – class is a keyword! | "class" is a reserved keyword in Python, so it cannot be used as a class name. |
